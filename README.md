# TwitterBot
TwitterBot made with python using "tweepy modue"
Here Two files are give 

1.TwitterBot
2.last_id_seen.txt

TwitterBot is Loopable script or program run on any kind of machine or web machine wither internet connection.
TwitterDeveloper provide api and one of them (Api) i used in this program which replace by "***".

How it's works :
It work with feting tweets from your time-line and find specific-mention which give in program and reply them by "Hello". 
In my case i wrote 'hello my frieds' and this tweet id store in 'last_seen_id.txt'.

last_seen_id.txt is use for store last tweet id for making bot smart beacuse if you store your last id seen then bot will repetly send 
"hello" inifity times until it stoped so it is important to have last_seen_id to make our bot smart not spame.
